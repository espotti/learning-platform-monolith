# LearnLite Backend

A minimal Express.js backend for the LearnLite learning platform, built with TypeScript.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with your configuration (see Configuration section below)

4. Start the PostgreSQL database:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will start on port 4000 (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Configuration

The application uses a centralized configuration system that loads from environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values:

### Environment Variables

- **PORT** (default: 4000) - Server port number
- **NODE_ENV** (default: development) - Environment mode: `development`, `test`, or `production`
- **JWT_SECRET** - Secret key for JWT tokens (REQUIRED in production)
- **DATABASE_URL** - PostgreSQL connection string (for future use)
- **LOG_LEVEL** (default: info) - Logging level: `error`, `warn`, `info`, or `debug`
- **APP_NAME** (default: learnlite) - Application name
- **NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED** (default: false) - Enable/disable notifications worker
- **NOTIFICATIONS_SINK** (default: console) - Where to send notifications: `console` or `file`

### Configuration Validation

The app validates configuration on startup:
- **Required variables**: In production, `JWT_SECRET` is required
- **Invalid values**: The app will exit with clear error messages for invalid configurations
- **Safe defaults**: Development and test environments use safe defaults for convenience
- **Security**: Secrets are never logged; only `[REDACTED]` appears in logs

## Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as its database. For local development, use Docker Compose:

### Starting the Database

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL in the background
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f postgres

# Stop the database
docker compose down
```

### Database Connection

The application connects to PostgreSQL using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The default configuration for Docker Compose is:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://learnlite:learnlite_dev_password@localhost:5432/learnlite
```

### Database Schema (v0.4)

The learning platform uses a comprehensive schema covering all core domain entities:

#### Core Tables

- **users** - Platform users (admin, instructor, student roles)
- **courses** - Learning courses with pricing and publishing status
- **lessons** - Course content with video URLs and markdown content
- **enrollments** - Student course enrollments with status tracking
- **lesson_progress** - Individual lesson completion tracking
- **quizzes** - Course assessments
- **quiz_questions** - Quiz questions with multiple choice answers (JSON)
- **quiz_submissions** - Student quiz attempts with scores
- **certificates** - Course completion certificates with unique codes
- **outbox_events** - Event sourcing for eventual consistency

#### Key Features

- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper relationships with cascading deletes
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate enrollments, progress entries, and certificates
- **Check Constraints**: Enforce valid enum values (user roles, enrollment status)
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **JSON Support**: Flexible storage for quiz choices and answers

### Migrations

This project uses `node-pg-migrate` for database migrations:

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run migrate:create migration-name

# Run pending migrations (creates schema + seed data)
npm run migrate:up

# Rollback the last migration
npm run migrate:down

# Check migration status
npm run migrate
```

#### Initial Setup

After starting the database, run migrations to create the schema and seed demo data:

```bash
# Start database
docker compose up -d

# Run all migrations (creates tables + demo data)
npm run migrate:up

# Verify setup
curl http://localhost:4000/readiness
```

The seed migration creates:
- Sample users (admin, instructor, students)
- A complete "Introduction to Web Development" course
- Enrollment and progress data
- Quiz questions and submissions
- A sample certificate

## Architecture (v0.8)

### Route-Controller Pattern

The application follows a clean Route-Controller pattern that separates routing concerns from business logic:

#### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── controllers/          # Business logic handlers
│   ├── auth.controller.ts
│   ├── users.controller.ts
│   ├── courses.controller.ts
│   ├── lessons.controller.ts
│   ├── enrollments.controller.ts
│   ├── progress.controller.ts
│   ├── quizzes.controller.ts
│   └── certificates.controller.ts
├── routes/               # HTTP route definitions
│   ├── index.ts         # Main router that mounts all subrouters
│   ├── auth.routes.ts
│   ├── users.routes.ts
│   ├── courses.routes.ts
│   ├── lessons.routes.ts
│   ├── enrollments.routes.ts
│   ├── progress.routes.ts
│   ├── quizzes.routes.ts
│   └── certificates.routes.ts
├── middleware/          # Common middleware
│   ├── requestId.middleware.ts
│   ├── logging.middleware.ts
│   └── errorHandler.middleware.ts
└── ...
```

#### Pattern Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Routes handle HTTP specifics, controllers handle business logic
- **Testability**: Controllers can be unit tested independently of Express
- **Consistency**: Uniform structure across all domain modules
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization makes the codebase easy to navigate

#### Controller Structure
Each controller exports an object with standard CRUD operations:
- `index` - GET / (list resources)
- `create` - POST / (create resource)
- `show` - GET /:id (get specific resource)
- `update` - PUT /:id (update resource)
- `remove` - DELETE /:id (delete resource)

### Middleware Stack

The application uses several middleware layers applied globally:

1. **Request ID**: Adds unique identifier to each request (`X-Request-ID` header)
2. **Logging**: One-line per request logging with timing
3. **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing enabled
4. **JSON Parsing**: Automatic JSON body parsing
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent JSON error responses
6. **404 Handler**: Clean JSON responses for unknown routes

## API Endpoints

## Authentication & RBAC (v0.6)

### Overview

The application implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC). Users can have one of three roles: `admin`, `instructor`, or `student`.

### Password Security

- **Hashing Algorithm**: bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **Justification**: Industry standard with built-in salt generation, adaptive cost factor for future-proofing, and excellent security-performance balance
- **Storage**: Only hashed passwords are stored; plain text passwords are never persisted

### JWT Configuration

- **Algorithm**: HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **Payload**: Includes `sub` (user ID), `email`, `role`, `iat`, and `exp`
- **Secret**: Configured via `JWT_SECRET` environment variable

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required in production, optional in development
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production

# Database connection (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://learnlite:learnlite_dev_password@localhost:5432/learnlite
```

### Authentication Endpoints

#### Register User
```bash
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "name": "User Name",
  "role": "student"  // Optional, admin-only. Defaults to "student"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 5,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "User Name",
    "role": "student",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "version": "v0.6"
}
```

#### Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 5,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "User Name",
    "role": "student",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "version": "v0.6"
}
```

#### Get Current User Profile
```bash
GET /api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Using Authentication

#### Include JWT Token in Requests
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" http://localhost:4000/api/users
```

#### Example Authentication Flow
```bash
# 1. Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123", "name": "Test User"}'

# 2. Login to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# 3. Use token to access protected endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token-from-login>" http://localhost:4000/api/auth/me
```

### Role-Based Access Control

#### Role Hierarchy
- **admin**: Full access to all resources
- **instructor**: Can create and manage courses, lessons, quizzes
- **student**: Can enroll in courses, track progress, take quizzes

#### Protected Endpoints Examples

**Users Management (Admin Only):**
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

**Course Management:**
- `GET /api/courses` - Public access (browse courses)
- `POST /api/courses` - Instructors and admins only
- `PUT /api/courses/:id` - Instructors and admins only
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id` - Admins only

#### Authentication Errors

**401 Unauthorized** - Missing or invalid token:
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Missing or invalid Authorization header. Expected: Bearer <token>",
    "requestId": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**403 Forbidden** - Insufficient permissions:
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Access denied. Required role(s): admin. Your role: student",
    "requestId": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Middleware Components

#### `authenticate()`
- Validates JWT tokens from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Attaches `req.user` with `{id, email, role}` for authenticated requests
- Returns 401 for invalid/missing tokens

#### `requireRole(...roles)`
- Must be used after `authenticate()` middleware
- Checks if `req.user.role` matches allowed roles
- Returns 403 for insufficient permissions

#### Usage in Routes
```typescript
// Require authentication
router.use(authenticate);

// Require specific role(s)
router.get('/admin-only', requireRole('admin'), controller.adminAction);
router.post('/instructors', requireRole('instructor', 'admin'), controller.create);
```

## Progress Module (v1.1)

### Overview
The Progress module tracks per-lesson completion for enrolled students, enabling progress percentage calculations and future certificate eligibility. Students can mark lessons as complete/incomplete, view their progress, and instructors can see aggregated course progress.

### Features
- **Lesson Completion Tracking**: Students mark lessons as complete/incomplete
- **Progress Calculation**: Automatic percentage calculation based on completed lessons
- **Idempotent Operations**: Marking completion multiple times is safe
- **Role-Based Access**: Students see own progress, instructors see course aggregates
- **Course Progress Overview**: Instructors view all students' progress in their courses

### API Endpoints

#### Progress Management

##### Mark Lesson Complete/Incomplete
```http
POST /api/progress/complete
Authorization: Bearer <student-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "enrollmentId": 1,
  "lessonId": 2,
  "completed": true
}

Response:
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "enrollmentId": 1,
    "lessonId": 2,
    "completed": true,
    "completedAt": "2024-01-21T10:30:00Z",

        "completed": false,
        "completed_at": null
      }
    ]
  },
  "version": "v1.1"
}
```

##### Get Course Progress (Instructor/Admin)
```http
GET /api/courses/:courseId/progress
Authorization: Bearer <instructor-token>

Response:
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "user": {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Alice Student",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
      },
      "completedCount": 4,
      "totalLessons": 5,
      "percent": 80
    },
    {
      "user": {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Bob Learner",
        "email": "bob@example.com"
      },
      "completedCount": 2,
      "totalLessons": 5,
      "percent": 40
    }
  ],
  "count": 2,
  "version": "v1.1"
}
```

### Business Rules

#### Progress Tracking
- Students can only mark progress for their own enrollments
- Lesson must belong to the enrolled course
- Completed status can be toggled (true/false)
- First completion sets `completed_at` timestamp
- Marking incomplete clears `completed_at`

#### Access Control
- **Students**: Can mark/view own progress only
- **Instructors**: Can view aggregate progress for own courses
- **Admins**: Can view aggregate progress for any course
- Students can view progress regardless of course publish state

#### Validation
- Enrollment ID must exist and belong to the authenticated user
- Lesson ID must belong to the enrollment's course
- Cross-course lesson marking is prevented
- Completed flag must be boolean

### Usage Examples

```bash
# 1. Student marks lesson as complete
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/progress/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <student-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enrollmentId": 1,
    "lessonId": 2,
    "completed": true
  }'

# 2. Student checks their progress for a course
curl http://localhost:4000/api/progress/me?courseId=1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <student-token>"

# 3. Student marks lesson as incomplete (changed mind)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/progress/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <student-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enrollmentId": 1,
    "lessonId": 2,
    "completed": false
  }'

# 4. Instructor views all students' progress in their course
curl http://localhost:4000/api/courses/1/progress \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <instructor-token>"
```

### Database Schema

```sql
lesson_progress (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  enrollment_id INTEGER REFERENCES enrollments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  lesson_id INTEGER REFERENCES lessons(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(enrollment_id, lesson_id)
)

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX ON lesson_progress(enrollment_id);
```

### Integration Notes

- Progress percentage is calculated as: `(completed_lessons / total_lessons) * 100`
- Progress data is used for certificate eligibility (100% completion required)
- Idempotent operations ensure safe retry behavior
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate progress records
- CASCADE delete maintains referential integrity

## Notifications Module (v1.3)

The notifications module implements an **outbox pattern** for reliable async event processing. Events are written to the `outbox_events` table and processed by a background worker.

### Configuration

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable/disable the notifications worker
NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true

# Where to send notifications: 'console' or 'file'
# If 'file', notifications will be written to var/notifications.log
NOTIFICATIONS_SINK=console
```

### How It Works

1. **Event Publishing**: Key actions (like enrollment creation) publish events to the outbox
2. **Background Worker**: Polls every 5 seconds for unprocessed events
3. **Processing**: Events are logged (console or file) and marked as processed
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Worker stops cleanly on SIGINT/SIGTERM

### Supported Events

- `enrollment.created` - Triggered when a student enrolls in a course
- `certificate.issued` - (Future) Triggered when a certificate is issued

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Check notifications worker health
curl http://localhost:4000/api/notifications/health
```

Response shows worker status:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "version": "v1.3",
  "enabled": true,
  "interval": 5000,
  "lastRunAt": "2025-01-21T15:30:45.123Z",
  "pendingEstimate": 3,
  "sink": "console"
}
```

### Monitoring

- **Console sink**: Events appear in server logs with 📨 prefix
- **File sink**: Events written as JSONL to `var/notifications.log`
- **Database**: Check `outbox_events` table for event history

### Example Event Flow

1. Student enrolls in a course
2. Event published to outbox: `enrollment.created`
3. Worker picks up event within 5 seconds
4. Event logged/saved and marked as processed

### Database Schema

The outbox_events table (created in migrations):
```sql
outbox_events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  topic VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

## Certificates Module (v1.2)

### Overview
The Certificates module enables course completion certificates with eligibility checking, issuance by instructors/admins, self-claiming by students, and public verification via unique codes. Certificates are automatically issued when students complete all course requirements.

### Features
- **Eligibility Checking**: Validates enrollment and completion before issuance
- **Instructor Issuance**: Instructors can issue certificates to eligible students
- **Student Self-Claim**: Students can claim their own certificates when eligible
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify a certificate using its unique code
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes `certificate.issued` events to the outbox
- **Duplicate Prevention**: One certificate per (user, course) pair enforced

### API Endpoints

  "version": "v1.2"
}
```

### Eligibility Rules

A certificate can be issued when:
1. **Active Enrollment**: User has an active enrollment in the course
2. **Completion Criteria** (one of):
   - All lessons completed (100% progress via lesson_progress table)
   - Enrollment status is 'completed'
3. **No Duplicate**: No existing certificate for the same (user, course) pair

### Business Rules

#### Issuance
- Instructors can only issue certificates for their own courses
- Admins can issue certificates for any course
- Eligibility is checked before issuance
- Duplicate certificates are prevented (409 Conflict)

#### Claiming
- Students can only claim certificates for courses they're enrolled in
- Must meet eligibility requirements
- Self-service when requirements are met

#### Verification
- Public endpoint (no authentication required)
- Returns minimal information (no emails)
- Invalid codes return `valid: false`
- Consistent response format for security

### Certificate Code Format

Codes are generated in the format: `CERT-XXXXXX-XXXXXX`
- 12 random characters (base64url)
- URL-safe and unique
- Easy to share and verify

### Event Integration

When a certificate is issued (via issue or claim), an event is published:
```javascript
{
  topic: "certificate.issued",
  payload: {
    certificateId: 1,
    userId: 3,
    courseId: 1,
    code: "CERT-A1B2C3-D4E5F6"
  }
}
```

This event is processed by the notifications worker if enabled.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# 1. Instructor issues certificate to eligible student
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/certificates/issue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <instructor-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 3,
    "courseId": 1
  }'

# 2. Student claims their own certificate
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/certificates/claim \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <student-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"courseId": 1}'

# 3. Student views their certificates
curl http://localhost:4000/api/certificates/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <student-token>"

# 4. Instructor views all certificates for their course
curl http://localhost:4000/api/courses/1/certificates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <instructor-token>"

# 5. Public verification of certificate
curl http://localhost:4000/api/certificates/CERT-A1B2C3-D4E5F6
```
