When instructed to create a new JIRA ticket, always use the Atlassian MCP server.

• Create the ticket under the rafael-patino-demos (RPD) project.
	
• Always include exactly one tag by default: "created_by_cascade".
	
• Add repository name and URL in the description DO NOT FORGET

• Do not use any other method—always use the MCP server for ticket creation.
